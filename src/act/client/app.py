"""
Flask application module for aCT's RESTful interface.

Functions anotated with @app.route are ones that respond to requests.
All of them require client certificate to authenticate user and allow
operations. The client certificate has to be a proxy certificate that is
created by user. The only exception is request that submits a new proxy
certificate: this one requires user to use personal certificate.

There are also some utility functions which are common to all response
functions.
