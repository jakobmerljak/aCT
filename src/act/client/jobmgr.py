class JobManager(object):
    """
    Object for managing jobs using tables in aCT database.

    MySQL errors that might happen are ignored unless stated otherwise where
    they are not.

    This object works heavily with ARC engine. It does that by feeding job
    information to ARC engine's table and reading job information from that
    table.

    Object has two sets of methods: methods that operate on one job and
    methods that operate on multiple jobs. Single job operations were
    implemented first and provided very verbose information to client when
    something went wrong. This approach required multiple queries for every
    single job which is very ineffective.

    Job operations were changed to solve this. Now, every database operation
    on jobs happens on all jobs that client requested in one single query.
    That means that it's impossible to see for instance why operation
    could not be executed on certain jobs that client requested. To find out,
    job state has to be checked (which makes sense). So the following
    approach is used when something goes wrong: instead of relying on
    for instance job cleaner to tell why not all jobs were cleaned, client
    should check the state of those jobs that were not cleaned.

    The former job management approach will probably be removed in future, as
    it's not used anymore.
